# ML
This repository contains some notebooks where I implement some optimization techniques or machine learning models to gain a better understanding of the subjects.
The demonstrates are to help me solidify my understanding - the algorithms and strategies used are not optimized.

Some of the notebooks are inspired by problems or ideas posed in the Convex Optimization textbook by Boyd and Vandenberghe or in the Statistical Learning books by Tibshirani and Hastie
